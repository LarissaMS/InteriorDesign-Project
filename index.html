            Japandi design is the combination of Scandinavian functionality and Japanese rustic minimalism to create a feeling of
            art, nature, and simplicity. This fusion creates the perfect blend of function and form, focusing on clean lines,
            bright spaces, and light colors.
            Aspects of the Scandi notion of ‘hygge’ - the Nordic term for the homely feeling of cosiness - and Japanese ‘wabi-sabi’ - 
            finding beauty in imperfection - harmonise to create a stress-free atmosphere.

          Elements of Japandi
          </h2>
          <p>
            The perfect fusion of Japanese and Scandinavian, Japandi design focuses on minimalistic designs that are aesthetically
            pleasing yet highly functional.
            One can expect to find a plethora of natural materials, muted colors, clean lines, and minimal, yet
            well-curated, furnishings. Japandi design isn't sparse—it's intentional.
            Japandi styles feature beautiful craftsmanship with a focus on quality and handmade pieces over throwaway, cheap
            structures.
            You'll also see a lot of neutral colors and paint choices to complement Japandi furniture and accessories. Calming,
            tranquil, and peaceful palettes are typically chosen, and when brighter colors are incorporated, they are done so
            meaningfully and subtly.
            Additionally, Japandi styles often emphasize sustainability. The prevalence of natural materials and simple designs
            makes it a great green decor style. With more and more consumers looking toward eco-friendly aesthetics, Japandi's
            popularity is no surprise.

          <h2>
            How to Decorate in Japandi Style
          </h2>
          <p>
            To really play with this look, focus on natural materials such as unfinished woods or bamboo pieces that bring in the
            feeling of nature and simplistic beauty. It is recommended to use muted colors with hints of pale green or bringing plants
            and greenery into your home to give it a sense of outdoor living.
            Reducing clutter is also key to achieving the Japandi style. This design aesthetic focuses on clean lines and open
            spaces. But if you have an active household and struggle to find that minimalist look, try "faux
            minimalism" with natural containers such as boxes and baskets, built-ins or folding screens to hide excess stuff and
            keep your space feeling clutter-free.
            <br />
            To get the best of both worlds, draw on the coziness of Scandi design with warm textures and soft pieces while
            maintaining the elegance of Japanese decor. While both styles have a focus on the utilitarian, it's important to
            maintain a zen-like sense of calm in your space.
            <br />
            Because Japandi design is focused on craftsmanship, it's not meant to be throwaway. Look for pieces that will stand the
            test of time and work with your decor for years to come. It's a clear antidote to the one-time-use culture we have
            embraced for so long. Instead, focus on pieces that are sustainable and safe for our planet.
