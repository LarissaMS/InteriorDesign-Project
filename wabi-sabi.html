          Wabi-sabi is a Japanese term that essentially means finding beauty in imperfection. Wabi refers to living with humility
          and simplicity while being at one with nature, while sabi is defined as the ability to accept the lifecycle of anything
          as it is—flaws and all.

          In the context of interior design and decor, a wabi-sabi home is one that embraces authenticity, finds value in the
          lovingly weathered and lived-in, and promotes an overall sense of peace and tranquility using simplicity. Rather than
          always adding the latest shiny new thing or obsessing over making every detail perfect, adopters of wabi-sabi interiors
          find harmony in authenticity and imperfection. Such an approach might well be the antidote you’ve been looking for in
          our chaotic, perfection-obsessed world.

          Wabi-sabi is a Japanese philosophy that has been around since the 15th century. It came about as a reaction to the
          dominant trends of the time, which relied heavily on over-ornamentation, lavishness, and the use of rare materials.In
          direct contrast, wabi-sabi is all about finding beauty in imperfection. It involves grounding oneself by forming a deep
          connection to the earth and enjoying the simple pleasures of life. Above all, it centers around recognizing the
          importance of authenticity and striving to remain authentic in all aspects of one’s life.For some, wabi-sabi is more of
          a guiding principle than a design trend. It’s about accepting things as they are, rather than spending your time wishing
          for something better, and retraining yourself to find the positives in less-than-ideal situations.
