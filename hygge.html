          Hygge (pronounced hue-guh) is a Danish word. The Hygge definition means a certain quality of coziness, and when
          incorporated into interior design, it helps to bring a feeling of well-being or contentment into your home. In other
          words, it is a state of mind that will have you feeling present in your environment and enjoying the present.
          
          When we talk about hygge in interior design, it is about creating intimacy and bringing coziness into your home. Hygge
          style is not cluttering your home up with expensive furnishings and artwork, although you can certainly create a cozy
          feeling in that way. It is more about enjoying life’s simpler side.
          
          The cozy meaning of hygge has played a role in Danish culture since early in the 1800s. It made its way across the ocean
          to the US in 2017, with eight books published on the topic within a few months of each other.
          
          Hygge décor became one of the hottest home design trends in 2017. Does that mean you have already missed the bandwagon?
          Not at all, remember, it is not as much about style as it is creating a feeling.
